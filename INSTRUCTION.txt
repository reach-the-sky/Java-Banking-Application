Options:
	1. Just run the jar file - It is the output of the code that we converted as to reduce the difficulty in running the code.
	2. Install an IDE and the required dependencies.
Mam, instructions to run the java file - (If you want to run the java file in your system):
	-> Install eclipse.
	-> Add json.jar file as a library.
	-> Add fakery.png and client.json file to the path.
	-> Run GUI.java file (Banking.java file should be in the same directory).
	-> Output is the same as Banking.jar file.
